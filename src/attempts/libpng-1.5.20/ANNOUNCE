Changes since the last public release (1.5.19):
  Removed "option WRITE_COMPRESSED_TEXT enables WRITE_TEXT" from pnglibconf.dfa
  Only mark text chunks as written after successfully writing them.
  Avoid out-of-bounds memory access in png_user_version_check().
  Simplified and future-proofed png_user_version_check().
  Quieted three "comparison is always false due to limited range" compiler
    warnings in pngset.c
  The macros passed in the command line to Borland make were ignored if
    similarly-named macros were already defined in makefiles. This behavior
    is different from POSIX make and other make programs.  Surround the
    macro definitions with ifndef guards (Cosmin).
  Use memcpy instead of CopyMemory in the definition of png_memcpy.
    The Borland C++ build breaks otherwise (Cosmin).
  Added "-D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" to CFLAGS in scripts/makefile.vcwin32
  Removed the obsolete $ARCH variable from scripts/makefile.darwin.
