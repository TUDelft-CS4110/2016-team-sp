What you will learn from reading the papers:
\begin{list}
    \item What are fuzzing and concolic testing methods, what bugs can you find using them?
    \item When is it beneficial to test concolicly?
\end{list}

              \item When to use what?
                    \item when blackbox more effective than whitebox and vise versa
          \end{list}
    
    \item Concolic Testing
          \begin{list}
              \item Introduction
              \item Concrete and Symbolic Testing
              First run on concrete input -> gather symbolic constraints from conditional statements. -> Test alternative paths by systematically negating collected constraints -> check if new expression is satisfiable.
