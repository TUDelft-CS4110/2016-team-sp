## Discussed:
### Progress with libpng library
The initial idea of using libpng was to get familiar with angr. We didn't get any results in terms of found bugs from it.
However it gave a good impression of what to expect from angr and how to utilise it in our particular case.

### Crackme/keygenme 
We discussed [challenge 45](http://challenges.re/45/) and [challenge 74](http://challenges.re/74/). 
Challenge 45 might not suit our case and challenge 74 was already taken by another team. 
So we will continue to look for other binaries that will suffice.
After we find a suitable crackme binary we will try and find a path to the success state and try to 
concolic test in order to find a path to that state without giving a key or license as input.

### Documentation / Report
If succesful, we wish to propose our case including documentation to angr.io as a possible tutorial or 
example as a hands on introduction to the angr tool. 
We might nog be able to contribute to the technical documentation, however we can imagine that we can set up an
initial version of the introduction which might take the angr team little effort to tweak.

## From here on:
- Find suitable crackme/keygenme
- Find memory address of succes state (either by debugging with angr or by using gdb)
- Let angr find all possible paths to this success state
- Document these paths???
- See if there are any paths that lead to the success state without needing the otherwise required input
