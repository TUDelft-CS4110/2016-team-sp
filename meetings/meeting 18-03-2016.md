#Meeting 18/03/2016
## Attendees: 
- Patrick (student)
- Mark (TA)

## Discussed:
### Possible tools and ideas for lab.  

The first possibility is to compare a concolic tool with a fuzzing tool on the same codebase (e.g. an old version of libpng).

Another possibility is just about using concolic testing on crackme tools in order to find out if concolic testing can find the right combinations to get to the 'Success state' leading to a valid key. Although this is going to the direciton of reverse engineering, its still a possiblity for us. See [challenges.re](challenges.re) for crackme tools.

There's a lot of freedom. If we get other ideas we can probably discuss them. If we have any questions, use slack.

### Concolic testing:
- jCute
- angr.io
    - No clicking and dragging, just programming. So it sounds nice.
    - Might be quite a hassle to get it to work, not much documentation available

### Fuzzing:
- afl fuzzer
    - Easy to configure
    - If it finds a crash, use crash analyzer software (afl utils or afl crash anaylzer) to check if crash is exploitable

### Report
- All written sourcecode, also on github.
- How and why, so explain our choices.
- Results.
- Conclusion.

## From here on:
- Discuss possibilities with Sander and decide on the topic
- Get familiar with the tools, test own code or easy examples
- Next meeting:
    - Discuss progress with Mark and Sicco
